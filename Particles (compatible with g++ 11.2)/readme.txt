To access the SDL project just open the folder 'SDLTemplate' in VS Code and open main.cpp
To run main.cpp access integrated terminal and run command ./main
To build project access integrated terminal and run command make

In this case the make file is using files from C:drive. It is using the SDL2 files that came along with the g++ 11.2 compiler.
